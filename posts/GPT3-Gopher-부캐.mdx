title: GPT3, Gopher, and 부캐(Sub Account)

There's been a bit of a hiatus since my last post, but the recent paper from Deepmind motivated me to write up a quick post.

You can check the [Deepmind Blog Post](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale) to see the original graph.

Looking at the rate of innovation from GPT-3 to Gopher against the human benchmark, it seems like a huge portion of white-collar labor performed by humans will be reduced by pretrained models within the next decade. When BERT was introduced in 2019 and presented groundbreaking performances, it had 340 million parameters, after 2 years, Gopher has 280 billion parameters, which is an improvement of roughly 1000x.
It would be naive to expect that people would have the resources necessary to be adaptive in this increasingly scarce market for human labor. Macro solution
may involve social safety net or education reform but that is way out of the scope of this post. Rather, I would like to introduce a recent trend popularized in
Korea.

This may sound a bit off tangent but there's a phrase called '부캐(sub-character)' in Korean which originated in the gaming community.
It's a term when players make a second account to play more casually than their main account. Now that term has evolved to refer to 
people who develop their hobby or gimmick extensively on social media for engagement and potentially create a second income. 
This works sort of like a hedging strategy against job automation risk by being involved in multiple industries. This is not neccessarily about
the income but having a platform for social engagement through their hobby/side job.
I have personally been exploring a few hobbies that do not involve staring at a screen(which I do more than enough for my main job) like jazz piano. 
I am at no level to share it currently but I hope to show my progress shortly. If you are reading this, I encourage you to actively explore in
creating a 부캐(pronounced as boo-keh).
